This is a code base created for the assignment of Reinforcement Learning course taught in University of Edinburgh by Pavlos Andreadis, Stefano Albrecht and Arrasy Rahman (http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/18-19/dpt/cxinfr11010.htm).

It includes the implementation of classic Reinforcement Learning algorithms (Q-Learning, SARSA, Monte Carlo), Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm as well as multi-agent learning algorithms (Independent Q-Learning, Joint Action learning, Wolf PHC).
